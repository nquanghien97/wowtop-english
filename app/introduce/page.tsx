                <p className="mb-4 text-xl text-[#002A9E] uppercase font-semibold"> is a high-quality nutritional formula designed for children aged 1 and above, providing essential nutrients for their growth and development.</p>

                  <p className="mb-2"><strong>WOWTOP nutritional milk</strong> powder is the result of the latest scientific research that applies a mechanism for height growth from osteoblastsâ€”a breakthrough in surpassing genetic.</p>
                  <p className="mb-2">Thanks to its high content of CBP (standardized colostrum protein), WOWTOP increases both the quantity and quality of osteoblasts, promoting bone growth beyond genetic potential. This boosts the body&lsquo;s demand for essential minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, ensuring complete bone development. WOWTOP contains the highest mineral content on the market, providing the necessary nutrients for optimal bone growth, helping children exceed their height potential.</p>
                  <p>WOWTOP is imported from New Zealand, renowned for producing the &quot;best milk in the world&quot; from cows that graze on natural grass. This ensures the milk is clean, nutrient-rich, and meets the highest global standards for infant nutrition.</p>
                  <p>Using WOWTOP helps children grow taller not just in height, but also in bone quality. Thanks to the CBP (Standardized Colostrum Protein) mechanism, it activates bone progenitor cells, enhancing the growth and strength of the bone structure. This mechanism maximizes calcium and mineral absorption, supporting superior height development in both &quot;quantity&quot; (cm of height) and &quot;quality&quot; (bone density and strength).</p>
